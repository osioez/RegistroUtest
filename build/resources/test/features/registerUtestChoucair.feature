  Scenario: Register on Utest

    Given the Utest website we look for the Join Today registration

      | strFirstName | strLastName | strEmail           |  strMonth    | strDay  | strYear |
      |   Mario      | Gonzalez    |magodeoz@correo.com |     june     | 25      | 1995    |

    When you enter this section you fill in the required information and save

      | strFirstName | strLastName |strEmail            |  strMonth    | strDay  | strYear |
      |   Mario      | Gonzalez    |magodeoz@correo.com |     june     | 25      | 1995    |

    Then this stores the user to then be able to access and use the services of the platform

      | strFirstName | strLastName |strEmail            |  strMonth    | strDay  | strYear |
      |   Mario      | Gonzalez    |magodeoz@correo.com |     june     | 25      | 1995    |
